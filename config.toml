text = """Hello! My name is NAGAHARA IKUMA, I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at East China Normal University in Shanghai, China. I enjoy studying in an international environment alongside my Chinese classmates, which enriches my academic and cultural experiences.

I have a passion for traveling and have visited several countries, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Dubai, Italy, and South Korea. These experiences have allowed me to explore diverse cultures and perspectives, which have greatly enhanced my intercultural understanding and broadened my horizons.

In my professional career, I worked for approximately two years at Pixel Software Corporation in Japan, where I developed industrial real-time process information management systems and factory data management software. Following that, I completed a remote internship at “Tomorrows AI” in the United States, where I contributed to media platform development.

Leveraging my multicultural experiences and technical skills, I aspire to contribute to international projects and create innovative value as a professional engineer. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to connecting with you!
